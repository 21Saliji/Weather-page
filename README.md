# Weather-page
This is my first html project.

Welcome to the Weather Page project! This web application is supposed to provide real-time weather information for locations around the world. Whether you're planning a trip, checking the forecast for your city, or simply curious about the weather, this page should hv you covered.Unfortunately its not intergrateed with an api thus no real time weather info.

I welcome feedback and contributions to make the Weather Page even better! If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute directly.
